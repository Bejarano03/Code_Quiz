## Developer Comments

This took me longer than expected and my only issue was my linking to index.html; regardless it was a fun activity. I really enjoying writing out the javascript in this file. 

I am just happy that I got to implement html, css and javascript in one app. This definitely made me rely a lot on google. Without it I wouldn't have gotten much done.

## User Story

# Code Quiz

## My Task

I was given the job to make a quiz that both works and fulfills the following requirements: 

* Must have a timer
* Must add up correct answers and incorrect answers
* Must have a highscore page
* Must have a link to highscore page

## How it works

The user is welcomed by a landing page letting them start the application, once the application starts running they are given a time of 75 seconds and questions to answer. Each right answers does not decrease the timer, but every wrong question does decrease it. At the end of the application the user is allowed to put in their initials for highscores.
